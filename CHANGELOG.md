- Added Inventory Shortcuts
- Added YACL and Modmenu config
- Added Party Member highlighting (theoretically, had no way to test if it acurately detects party members, but you can add/remove them manually by running `/isles_debug party_add_other` while looking at them, if they already are in the party, it will remove them)
- Other debug commands include `/isles_debug party_add_self` to add/remvoe yourself from the party and `/isles_debug set_render_target` to set/unset the target to the entity you are currently looking at for the qte line
